My experience using Azure was alright. There were many connection issues and run time issues, as many run times were very inconsistent. I would run code twice in a row occasionally with a small difference and the run time would exponentially increase and most likely give at least 1 connection error along the way. I wouldn't necessarily recommend using Azure other than just learning how to use it in case they need to in the future. It does give helpful results, such as row output and run time. I believe if it was more consistent and had less errors I'd recommend it. For future co-workers I wouldn't necessarily recommend it for a project, again due to the amount of errors caused.
